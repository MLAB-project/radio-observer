ChangeLog
=========

### v0.1 (2013-07-03)

Features:

  - WAV and Jack frontends.
  - FITS backend makes continuous snapshots of configured length in full resolution.

### v0.1.1 HOTFIX (2013-08-11)

Fixes:
  
  - There is a bug in the time-keeping code (file `src/WaterfallBackend.cpp`,
    line `WFTime time = outBuffer_.times[0];` To circumvent this, the current
    time at the time of writing the file is used for now.


Planned Features
----------------

### v0.2 (2013-07-??)

Features:

  - New ring buffer that would support both continuous snapshots and
    event-triggered data collection.
  - Implement a scripting language API and interpreter that could be used to
    detect events and control data collection.
